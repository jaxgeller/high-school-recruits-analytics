        player’s journey from high school to the NBA is generally filled with so many extenuating factors that it’s hard to find any sort of pattern regarding success or failure. There’s nothing much beyond the obvious when it comes to school choice, national exposure, attitude problems, etc. It truly depends on the individual.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        When looking at the data, it’s clear that about 6-7 of the top 10 prospects carve out legitimate NBA careers every year. Some don’t always live up to expectations, but they find a spot in the league and make plenty of money. There are only a few prospects billed as “can’t miss” who actually didn’t “miss” and went on to become all stars. Those are your

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant" target="_blank">Kevin Durants</a> — others include, if you’re interested:

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose" target="_blank">Derrick Rose</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins" target="_blank">DeMarcus Cousins</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving" target="_blank">Kyrie Irving</a>,

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiggins" target="_blank">Andrew Wiggins</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        Plenty “can’t miss” guys ended up having fine careers, but didn’t ascend to the level scouts anticipated:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Green" target="_blank">Gerald Green</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Oden" target="_blank">Greg Oden</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Beasley" target="_blank">Michael Beasley</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Mullens" target="_blank">BJ Mullens</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Selby" target="_blank">Josh Selby</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabazz_Muhammad" target="_blank">Shabazz Muhammad</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        But there are factors that vary for all these players. Some were billed can’t miss only because they were the best players in a relatively weak high school class (Green and Muhammad). Others were just overrated (Selby and Mullins). Then Oden and Beasley, both seen to be generational talents, floundered due to circumstances beyond their skill sets.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        So the real story behind this data is the anecdotal nuance. I decided to take a look at players who overperformed, underperformed and lived up to expectations, and examine the situations that led to their success or failure.
      </p>

      <p class="content-header">First, a quick note on the 2005 class:</p>
      <p class="content-text">
        The 2005 class is an outlier in the data set. This was the last high school class that was allowed to go directly to the NBA, but we kept it in only because of some interesting things.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        First thing worth noting is the amount of players from this class who were drafted in the second round and had/are having really solid NBA careers:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monta_Ellis" target="_blank">Monta Ellis</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Williams" target="_blank">Lou Williams</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McRoberts" target="_blank">Josh McRoberts</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Chalmers" target="_blank">Mario Chalmers</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Johnson" target="_blank">Amir Johnson</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)" target="_blank">Danny Green</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        That’s rare, but it also highlights the difference between how NBA teams drafted before and after the age limit was put in place. Ellis and Williams were lanky combo guards with legitimate scoring ability, but, coming out of high school with those frames, they were legitimate question marks. So what does this say about exposure in college? If Williams and Ellis had gone to college and proved some skeptics wrong, would they have gone higher? Or was it better for them to spend developmental time in the NBA, where coaches know what they want and aren’t fitting their game to college’s pace?
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        This wasn’t a great class to begin with, but the players who entered the NBA directly from high school and were still first round picks have had some issues staying in the league. I’m not sure if this says anything about accountability or expectations, but
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bynum" target="_blank">Andrew Bynum</a> and Gerald Green have both been in and out. Ellis and Williams, both second round picks not saddled with ridiculous expectations immediately following the draft, eventually found a place. Those questions about expectations and maturity, and busts like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olowokandi" target="_blank">Michael Olowokandi</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Brown" target="_blank">Kwame Brown</a>, led to the league implementing an age limit the following year.
      </p>

      <p class="content-header">Overperformer:</p>
      <p class="content-text">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Oladipo" target="_blank">Victor Oladipo</a>: There are only a few examples of players ranked this low exploding the way Oladipo did, but of all those guys, Oladipo’s case seems to be the most methodical. The other two that come to mind,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade" target="_blank">Dwyane Wade</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a>, weren’t even in the top 150 of high school rankings. But they both erupted in ways that were transcendent — basketball revolutionaries, of sorts, and two of the best pure athletes of our generation. Oladipo’s collegiate rise was similar, but the destination not as impactful, and that’s the only reason I mention these three in the same sentence — not to burden him with unrealistic expectations. The ball skills and scoring ability are what separated Wade and Westbrook, but Oladipo is almost as much a pure athlete. He was seen as an undersized guard with no ball skills or shooting ability — a project loaded with athletic potential. Sure enough, Oladipo fashioned himself as a lockdown defender and a competent shooter by his sophomore year. For every player that makes a leap like this, there are hundreds who don’t. The context for this seems to be a confluence of events that involve luck and personal motivation, but I think you can attribute most of it to the fact that Oladipo just figured things out. It didn’t matter if it was shooting, defense, ball handling or probing. He figured it out. Most players don’t.

      </p>

      <p class="content-header">Underperformer:</p>
      <p class="content-text">
        Josh Selby: The anti-Oladipo. A guy who Jerry Meyer billed as a pure scorer out of high school with elite athletic ability, Selby was never able to put it together. Poor shot selection, an inability to distribute and a proclivity for turnovers are some of the reasons he fell in draft positioning and couldn’t stayed in the league. But again, it’s worth noting circumstances here, and a lot of highly touted recruits who don’t pan out deal with struggles similar to Selby’s. We should start with the nine game suspension to start his freshman year at Kansas. Selby allegedly accepted impermissible benefits and was forced to pay back $5,000 for clothes, transportation and other courtesies. We’ve seen this before, but once a prospect is labeled a rule-breaker, narratives and hot takes start flooding in, and it’s often more than a 19-year old can bare. I’m not saying this affected Selby one way or the other, but in general, these suspensions and narratives do have a strong effect on college players. During an up-and-down freshman season, Selby also dealt with foot injuries. Injuries and NCAA burdens are certainly distractions. Often times, when scouts deem you a bust, a bust you become.

      <p class="content-header">Lived up to expectations:</p>
      <p class="content-text">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Knight_(basketball)" target="_blank">Brandon Knight</a>: We could look at the obvious guys here who matched or exceeded ridiculous expectations, like Kevin Durant or John Wall, but what about players who just turned out to be really good? Knight is a much more subtle than most players, and he made all the right decisions. Commonly referenced as one of the smartest players in his class due to a high GPA and general affability, Knight chose to attend Kentucky out of high school. He didn’t set the world on fire, but he flashed a good handle, elite shooting, generally good decision making and leadership as he guided UK to the Final Four as a 4 seed. Everything about Knight just works, and it has shown in the NBA. He made smart decisions at every turn, on and off the court. A lot of people said he wasn’t your typical Kentucky recruit — whatever that’s supposed to mean. But Knight made the right decision. Cal was pumping players straight to the NBA, especially point guards, and Knight made sure he jumped on the skillet while it was hot. The lesson here, I suppose, is if you want to live up to expectations, go to Kentucky?

        Most players are considered underperformers to the public only because every college fan base expects their top 50 recruit to be an NBA player. It's not that easy, clearly. The primary factors are skill and how that skill fits in the NBA's gameplay. But beyond that, coming out of high school, there are too many variables for each player to find any meaningful pattern on draft positioning. Players who get suspended and/or deal with eligibility issues pan out less. There are only 2-3 all stars per class, and around 10 useful NBA players. But it's often worth looking at why players got suspended or why they struggled. Does it have anything to do with talent, maturity, exploitation or environment? Basically, context is everything.
